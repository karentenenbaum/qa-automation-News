                        This week's storm in Southern California was expected to bring more snow to the mountains
                        and possibly some rain to the area, but forecasters said Thursday it will dry out over the
                        weekend.

                        in Los Angeles County. Mountainous areas received about a foot to a foot and a half of snow
                        starting Thursday afternoon, with up to another 8 inches of snow through Friday.

                        Another quarter-inch to one-third of an inch of rain could fall in Orange County
                        and in the Inland Empire by the end of Friday. About a quarter-inch to a half-inch
                        could fall in Los Angeles County.

                    <p>
                        “This storm should be weakening going into (Friday),” said Ryan Kittell,
                        a National Weather Service meteorologist. “But we might see a few lingering showers in the
                        mountains.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “But we’re expecting a dry weekend.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This year’s rainy season, which starts on Oct. 1, has brought about 5.5 inches of rain to
                        downtown
                        Los Angeles. The average normal for this time of year is 12 inches, Kittell said.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For John Wayne Airport in Orange County, there have been about 4 inches of rain so far,
                        7 inches below normal, said James Brotherton, another meteorologist.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There is still a chance for more showers in March and April,
                        but Kittell said it’s “more than likely we’ll be well below normal this year.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Although rain and snow are expected to finish by the weekend,
                        cold temperatures are expected to stick around for a few days.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “It’s going to be chilly like it’s been,” Brotherton. “Starting Saturday, it’s going to be dry
                        all
                        through
                        next
                        week.
                        Temperatures will not get warm but close to normal, so back into the 60s and 70s.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The high temperature forecasted for Long Beach was 58 degrees on Friday and 61 on Saturday.
                        Santa Ana’s high was 60 degrees on Friday and 64 on Saturday.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Riverside’s forecasted high for Friday was 57 and for Saturday was 63 degrees.
                        In the San Bernardino Mountains, Big Bear’s forecasted high was 32 degrees on Friday and 39 on
                        Saturday.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The cold temperatures in the mountains will keep snow on the ground and make road conditions
                        icy,
                        Brotherton
                        said.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “Be careful traveling over the mountains in the next couple of days,” he said.
                        “People should bring emergency supplies and expect to have travel delays or possibly be
                        stranded.”

                    Can’t wait to hop on the pandemic gardening train by planting some tomatoes this spring?
                    Want to know how to grow your favorite tomato varieties even better? The Southern California
                    News Group is putting out a newsletter all about those delicious fruits that are just waiting
                    to be sliced into salads, made into sauce and put in that feta tomato pasta that’s gone viral.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Garden Party is an eight week course-style newsletter to all things tomatoes.
                    Consider it your cheat sheet to growing great tomatoes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Here’s how it works:
                </p>
                <p>
                    1. Visit our newsletters page and sign up for Garden Party. It’s the one with the tomato on it.
                    (If you don’t have an account, you will need to make one, but don’t worry, it’s free.)
                </p>
                <p>
                    2. You’ll get a welcome email from us soon to let you know what to expect. Then we’ll start sending
                    you emails once per week for eight weeks beginning in mid-March (when you really start seeing tomato
                    plants in nurseries).
                </p>
                <p>
                    3. We’ll take you through all the important steps of the tomato growing process, from what you need to
                    know before you visit the nursery to what to do once you have fruit. We’ll tell you how to space your
                    tomato plants out; how often you should water your tomato plants; how to deal with the bugs and animals
                    that might eat your tomato plants; and what it means if your tomato plant is yellow, spotted or has flowers
                    falling off — and those are just a few of the things we’ll go over.
                </p>
